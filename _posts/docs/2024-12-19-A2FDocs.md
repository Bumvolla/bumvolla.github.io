# Prerequisites

## Audio 2 Face

Audio 2 face can be downloaded in the NVIDIAs Omniverse Launcher that can be found here: [Windows Omniverse Launcher Download](https://install.launcher.omniverse.nvidia.com/installers/omniverse-launcher-win.exe). Once installed just sign in and you will find the A2F install page in the "Exchange" tab.

### Audio 2 Face .usda file

You will need acces to a .usda file to load in the application. You can use the examples given by NVIDIA but ideally you should create your own for each character you want to animate so the animation has the better posible look.

To use an NVIDIAs provided example, search for the one that better suits your needs, open it and _save as_ it with the .usda file extension.

If you want to animate a metahuman with it search for _mark_solved_arkit_ in the examples tab.

### Disclaimer

Have in mind that Audio2Face application MUST be runing for this plugin to work.
It can be running in headless mode.

# Unreal Engine Blueprint Library

## Initialize A2F Manager

The implementation is created arround a general manager that ensures the conection with the API stills always the same and stores almost any value you will need when developing to conecxt with this application. 

Calling the _Create Audio 2 Face Manager_ function in any blueprint will create this manager. You should store it in a veriable so it dont get garbage collected.

The manager initialization will request the A2F IP and port, by default it assumes you're launching it in your own machine in the A2F default port. If it's not the case, here is where you should change it.

Once the manager is initialized you should bind any events that you will want to use in your development, more usual ones are:
- Get Instances
- Get Player Instances
- Get Stream Live Link Nodes
- Get Blend Shape Solvers

Binding is done like usual:
![image](/img/A2FDocs/InitialiceA2FManager.png)

Once binding is done, you have to load the .usda file you should have previously saved. I recomend to save it in the Unreals content folder so you can acces it from Bluepirnts _Get Project Content Directory_ node and append whatever route you decided to save it.

The .usda file usually last a little longer to load after the _On Complete_ notifies so I recomend to hardcode a few seconds delay after it before doing anything related to A2F. 

After that, you can request for the instances that the application will need to call almost all the functions.

![image](/img/A2FDocs/LoadUSD.png)

The events you previouly binded to those functions will be called once the instances are retrieved.

## General usage

### Accesing instances

Instances can be accesed in three diferent ways:
- **Using the Blueprint Node _Get Single Instance_ or _Get Single Player Instance_**

This is the safest way and will only return the instance if there's a single one of them, that should be the more usual scenario.
- **Get the index 0 from the return value of the event binded to the called function**

This way you are sure you requested the instances and A2F returned the instances so you can access them. Anyways is recomended to check if the value is valid to avoid accesing invalid memory adresses that would cause the application to crash.
- **Get the index 0 of the A2FManager instance variable**

Is the only way to acces them if you want to use just pure blueprint nodes and avoid using an axec pin. With this method is also recomended to check for the value validity.

![image](/img/A2FDocs/GetInstanceExample.png)
*In this example the three methods are showcased but you only have to use one of them*

Instances validity will be always checked before trying to acces them from code but anyways is safer to check if them are valid or not before using them as input.

From here everything is pretty straight forward, please remember:
- You must use the A2F manager to call any function related to A2F as the target.
- Almost all the functions will require you to provide one of the instances to call them.
- Store the instances in variables to make them easily accesible and to avoid getting them garbage collected if not used.

# Debugging

## Tooltips

All the blueprint nodes have a tooltip that explains to you what that node does and what the inputs and outpus mean if you hover the mouse over the node. Check there for explanations about each node usage.

## Logging 

This library will notice few critical results and print any error to the Unreal Log under the category of _Log\_Audio2Face_, if anything is not working check there for any message that may help you debug what's happening.
