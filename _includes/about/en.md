Hey, I am Sora Mas (a.k.a. _@bumvolla_). I am a Tech Artist focused on graphics and tooling, but I love challenges so you will usually find me researching about whatever new thing stuck in my brain.

I started my journey studying 3D for real time engines: modeling, sculpting, texturing... the whole thing. And in the way, I felt in love for real time engines: math, programming and problem solving. Now I'm working as Unreal Developer at [NewtonlabSpace](https://en.newtonlabspace.com) developing software solutions for a wide range of applicantions. 

I'm also part of Narobot (an organization where we play arround with 3D printing, robotics, 3D modeling and programming) organizing the [Narojam](https://x.com/NotARobot_Jam), a little newborn Game Jam.

As said I studied 3D art at [FX Animation](https://fxanimation.es/en/) but almost everything I know was learned at the internet.
